# air-quality-EDA
## Here I'm doing open-end exploratory data analysis for air quality data of India for year 2015-2020.
> We are using opendatasets, so we don't need to download datasets every notebook run will download it byself just user will have to provide kaggle credentials to get
## Objective

Here we have access to a large amount of granular data relating to the  concentration of major air pollutants in India and it will be interesting to see if the AQI is improving and will look at `Central Pollution Control Board(CPCB)` data and will check whether the [claim](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/95-out-of-131-cities-show-improvement-in-air-quality-govt-data-11662611900744.html) of reduced air pollution is being actually backed by data or not by media and goverment outlines. Before going further let's understand about the constituents of Air Pollution




Outline For Project is:

- Downloading a dataset from an online source kaggel.com on [air-quality-index  of india](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india)
- Data preparation and cleaning with Pandas
- Open-ended exploratory analysis and visualization
- Asking and answering interesting questions
- Summarizing inferences and drawing conclusions
